# A Basic Introduction to JavaScript

React Native, which the Furman Now! app is built in, is a JavaScript framework. That means that understanding React Native, and thus Furman now, 
requires a basic understanding of JavaScript.

This section of the documentation offers a basic introduction to key JavaScript capabilities that the Furman Now! codebase makes heavy usage of. This includes 
basic syntax, object decomposition, iterators, anonymous functions, and TypeScript.

This is not intended to be an exhaustive course explaining JavaScript; rather, it seeks to introduce concepts and put a name to them so that they may be more easily investigated.
